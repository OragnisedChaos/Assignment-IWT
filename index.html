      <p>
        The game is set in a fantasy-themed persistent world where the player is
        a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own
        village using the resources gained from attacking other player's
        villages with troops; earning rewards, buying them with medals or by
        producing them at their own village. The main resources are gold, elixir
        and dark elixir. Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to
        fifty people, who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and
        receive troops, and chat with each other.
